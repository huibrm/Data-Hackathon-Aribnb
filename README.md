## Improve Airbnb in Seattle & Boston
Seattle and Boston are two of the biggest business and innovation hubs in the country, attracting heavy traffic from tourists and professionals alike. The cities draw people from all walks of life ranging from computer scientists to business owners to startup specialists to tourist groups to college freshmen and their anxious freshman. Airbnb senses an opportunity to improve their rental programmes in these cities and would like to hear your suggestions on the same.
Airbnb wants you to conduct a study on how they can improve their current rental programmes for tourists and visiting professionals in either or both of these cities.
